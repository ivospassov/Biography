Hello, fellow programmers ðŸ‘‹! My name is Ivo Spassov, a student in Software University, Sofia. ðŸ‘€ My interest in programming originates from my study in High School of Electronics 'John Atanasoff'. I have continued to expand my technical competencies and skills in the aforementioned university, while studying simulatenously business and languages (English, German and Greek). The purpose is to provide not only technical competence, but also business and communication skills ðŸ“« that will undoubtedly put organisations in a more advantageous positionðŸ”¥.
